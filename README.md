# live-accordingly
Live life on purpose. Live what makes you happy.

![Make a list of things that make you happy. Make a list of things you do every day. Compare the lists. Adjust accordingly.](static/img/inspiration.png)

## The idea
I have way too many things I'd like to do that make me happy, and in many categories (work, personal life, hobbies, side-projects...) A simple web app could help me

- Compare and set relative priorities where it would otherwise be difficult
- Track what I'm doing every day over time
- Compare what I'm doing over time to my personal priority list
- Show me how I'm doing
